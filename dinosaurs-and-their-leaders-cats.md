## Journal entry on dinosaurs and their leaders (cats)
May 15, 145 Million BCE

I cannot believe the events of the past week. It seems that cats have taken over as the dominant species on Earth, and the dinosaurs are now their loyal subjects. I never would have thought that such a thing was possible, but I have seen it with my own eyes.

The cats are clever and cunning, and they seem to have a natural instinct for leadership. They have organized the dinosaurs into various groups, with each group led by a particularly cunning and formidable cat.

I have witnessed the dinosaurs following the cats' commands without question, as if they are under some sort of spell. It is a strange and unsettling sight.

Despite the cats' seeming dominance, I cannot help but feel a sense of admiration for the dinosaurs. They are powerful and majestic creatures, and it is a shame to see them reduced to this state.

I can only hope that this strange new order does not last forever, and that one day the dinosaurs will reclaim their rightful place as the dominant species on Earth.
